``sunpy`` is a Python software package that provides fundamental tools for accessing, loading and interacting with solar physics data in Python.
It includes an interface for searching and downloading data from multiple data providers, data containers for image and time series data, commonly used solar coordinate frames and associated transformations, as well as other functionality needed for solar data analysis.

It is the core library of the `SunPy Project <https://sunpy.org/>`__ that forms the foundation of the ecosystem of affiliated packages that aims to be a community-developed, free and open-source solar data analysis environment for Python.
This is the mission statement of the SunPy project.
