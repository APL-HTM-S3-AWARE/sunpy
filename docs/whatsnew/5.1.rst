Calculating the amount of solar eclipse
=======================================
In anticipation of the upcoming `"Great North American Eclipse" <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse_of_April_8,_2024>`__ on April 8, 2024, there is a new function :func:`sunpy.coordinates.sun.eclipse_amount` that returns how much of the Sun is occulted by the Moon at the specified observer location and time.
The output can be used to determine the start/end times of partial eclipse and of totality.

Computations using SPICE kernels
================================
The `SPICE <https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/>`__ observation geometry information system is being increasingly used by space missions to describe the locations of spacecraft and the time-varying orientations of reference frames.
The new `sunpy.coordinates.spice` module enables the use of the `~astropy.coordinates.SkyCoord` API to perform SPICE computations such as the location of bodies or the transformation of a vector from one coordinate frame to another coordinate frame.
Although SPICE kernels can define coordinate frames that are very similar to the frames that `sunpy.coordinates` already provides, there will very likely be slight differences.
Using `sunpy.coordinates.spice` will ensure that the definitions are exactly what the mission specifies and that the results are identical to other implementations of SPICE (e.g., CSPICE or Icy).

.. note::
    `sunpy.coordinates.spice` requires the optional dependency `~spiceypy.spiceypy` to be installed.
